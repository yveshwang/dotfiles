dotfiles
========
Yves Hwang, 01.04.2014

my personal dotfiles, completely based on

https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/ and https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles

In addition, .extra was added to provide the update-java-alternative function for OSX Maverick, and a prettier git log. 


Getting started
---------------
Copy all the files into your home directory and voila! Make sure they are configured to your liking.
